Fractal Drawing Code Repository

Welcome! This repository contains my fractal drawing code, available for anyone to use and experiment with. Most of the scripts use Python’s Tkinter library for graphical output.
Requirements

Most files require Tkinter, which is not included in the standard Python library. You’ll need to install it to run the code.

Installation Instructions:

Windows:
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
    
    pip install tk

If that doesn’t work, try:

    py -m pip install tk

Linux:
    Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
      
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk

Arch-based systems:
 
    sudo pacman -S python-tk

If these dont work: 
    May god help you.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code. Enjoy creating fractals!
